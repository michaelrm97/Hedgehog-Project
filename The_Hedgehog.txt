The hedgehog steps out into the sun
His only source of warmth
The piercing rays of the summer heat
Still less sharp than the quills of his peers

They tell him to step away from the sunlight
If he can't help becoming burnt
But only knives await
In the cold bosom of the cave

A single spine in a sea of isolation
A million spines in a sea of loneliness
At an arms length away
Only radiation reaches one another

Don't rely on others for your own happiness
