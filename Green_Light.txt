I see that green light next to you
In the distance, you are there
Across the bay between us
I feel it has gotten wider

A message sent across the water
And I pray that you receive it
Delivered yes, but not yet seen
I anxiously wait for reply

I hope you remember
Our deepest conversations
When we would let this world
Become a little less lonely for a while

Before it withered into flaky sentences
And one word replies

I know that you've been busy
Or occupied with someone else
But I'll wait patiently here because
I still believe in that green light
