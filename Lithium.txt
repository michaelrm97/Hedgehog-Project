One plus one is two
That I know to be true
For among all of these people
Its the case with me and you

But three's a crowd
That is often quite loud
I hope you get along

But sometimes when
We get together
An inharmonious song

An awkward glare
A vicious stare
The itchings of a fight

The third wheel gets stuck
In the grass
Setting this tricycle alight

And so I must accept the view
Against the friendliest desires
That though one plus one is two
One plus one plus one is fire
