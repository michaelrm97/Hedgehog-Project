As I stretched my wings and soared above the treeline
I looked down and noticed that the others were still near the ground 
I had no chains connected to my feet
No strings which bound them to each other

Even as I flew higher and higher
Leaving my peers far away
There was no doubt that I was free
And yet I felt a sense of envy 

The sun began to blind my senses
And then the cold ocean wind brought a chill to my feathers
With clear paths in every direction I ask myself
Where do I go from here?
