I don't belong to any group
No nucleus to call home
Its lonely in the outer shell
But at least I get to roam

There's too much energy in me
To stick to a single place
And so I jump from atom to atom
A solitary race

Travelling through the continents
Seeking fame and wealth
Its I that allows conduction
But frankly I conduct myself

Outside of all the atoms
Through the crystalline matrix I whirl
A delocalized electron
Bringing light to the world
