It is easy to see the world in black and white
And so often we tempt ourselves into believing
That the entire world is one shade or another

Everything can be broken down into two categories
Perfection and failure
Right and wrong
Good and bad

It is convenient for our minds to think in absolutes
We judge people as smart or dumb, handsome or ugly, loyal or traitorous
Exam results are definitively good or definitively bad
A couple can either be perfect soul mates, or perfect enemies

Life either results in outstanding success or it is a categorical disaster

So as we navigate through life we realise
That it is easy to be on top and ride the waves of success
And it is easy to be at the bottom and resign yourself to oblivion

But to be in the middle is to struggle
To constantly strive to move upwards and improve
To not surrender to the ease of nothingness

Our lives are either going well, or not at all
And sometimes we switch between these two perspectives on a whim
In seeing ourselves as good or bad

What does it mean to be good?
Does it mean skillfully good?
Does it mean ethically good?
Is it a statistical category- above a mean or median?
Is there a discrete difference between good and bad?

Perhaps we are better described as waves than particles

Stop the search for perfection in everything
But instead look deeper into that which is hard to categorise
There is no need for complete optimisation
When all you ever really wanted was love and happiness

Cast away the false dichotomies and excluded middles
And admit some colour into this world
Then perhaps you will realise
That this world is more beautiful than ever

To move forward is to struggle
To struggle is to accept
That we are not simple shades of black and white
We are people, living in a world of grey
