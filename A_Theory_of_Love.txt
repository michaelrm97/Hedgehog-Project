Every so often you meet a person
That makes you question all your theories of love
Someone who keeps you up at night
Rearranging all the equations in your head
In the hope that we could be

The classical theory gave me no chance
I could not compete with his figure
The attraction to him was clear to see
Compared I was no measure

But relativity gave me some hope
We discovered our interests aligned
Bonding over a TV show or song
I took it as a comforting sign

Now the quantum theory deals with
The interaction of two people
Who with every meeting form
A unique relationship

Through every midnight conversation
And unproductive study sessions
Our lives become entangled
I grew closer to you

But the theory of everything
Presents a fundamental truth
The way you look at him is different
From the way I'm looked at by you

I'm hoping that one day
My theories of love will prove untrue
For by my current understanding
I will never be with you
